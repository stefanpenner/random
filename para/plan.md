cnstruct fun primitives for performance safe productive concurrency

* fun
* quick
* promises
* cancellation
* lifetimes
* actors
* management trees
  * http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-4.9.1/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html
* priorities ( dependencies )
  * like BB but more fluid and likely based on promises
* parallelism
  * (same machine or distributed)
  * WW / JXCore / ChildProcess / Green Cooperation (obviously only for such algorithims)
* safely splitting work
* consensus
* deliverability
* linearized / convergent
* debuggable
  * causeway ...
  * long-stack traces...
* buzzwords
